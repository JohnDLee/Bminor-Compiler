BMinor Compiler - Compilers Project Fall 2022 by John Lee
---------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains the code for the BMinor compiler.

The compiler is split into 5 distinct steps: Scanning, Parsing, Printing, Typechecking, and Code generation.

Scanning
  - The Flex program is used to tokenize the words of our BMinor program using a regular expression matcher.
  - '''./bminor -parse sourcefile.bminor'''
Parsing
  - Bison is used
